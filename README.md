# Alphabet Aerobics

This project demonstrates a machine learning model made using [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/),
a tool that let's anyone make machine learning models without writing any code. 

We trained a model to detect a person in different body positions that represent letters, but you can train your own model to do anything you want! 
Read more about how to train a pose model in our [blog post](https://medium.com/p/f4f6116f491).

## More Details and Documentation
This project uses the `tmPose` library. To learn more about this library,
how to use it, read the [documentation](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachablemachine-community/tree/master/libraries/pose).

## Share What You Make!
If you make something cool on glitch with Teachable Machine,
send us your project at [teachablemachine-support@google.com](mailto:teachablemachine-support@google.com) 
so we can add it to [our collection!](https://glitch.com/@teachablemachine/teachable-machine-showcase), 
or share your project on twitter using #teachablemachine so we can check it out!
